# Snake-game
A basic snake game

## Introduction
This is a basic snake game. The rules are simple and follow those of old version of snake game.

## How the game works
* The game ends when the snake bites itself, or the maximum score (which can be set in the **Settings** section) is reached.
* When the snake hits an edge, it continues to go through to the opposite edge.

## Features
* Customisable colours: Snake's head, snake's body, food
* Settings are saved in an INI file
* Customisable snake's speed and size

## About this project
This project is to help me get familiar with __Paint__ event and __Invalidate__ function of __PictureBox__ control. Besides, I also found a good way to save settings into a single INI file.
